          "issue_body": "### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\nLast night I made this post:\n\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mcc/113514552341290968\n\nIt features a video made in portrait mode with my phone. The video is \"1080p sideways\", 1080x1920.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nmastodon.social is displaying the video with a 1080p aspect ratio, in other words, 1920x1080. To do this, it crops the video down vertically, so that only a slice at the bottom of the video can be seen.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nBecause I am allowed to post 1080x1920 *images* without issue and they appear at their full height, I expect it would appear at its full height in the Mastodon feed. If for some policy reason it must be cropped, I expect I should be allowed to place a \"focus point\" (it seems you can't do this with videos).\n\n### Detailed description\n\n* The problem occurs in both Advanced and \"regular\" mode. \n* The problem here is the CSS and not the-video-as-stored-on-mastodon's-server. I know this for four reasons: Because [url=https://mastodon.social/@leona/113514663103374885]leon looked at the inspector[/url] and found a \"aspect-ratio: 1920 / 1080\" in the css; because if you click fullscreen, it appears correctly; because in the \"edit\"/add alt text pane it appears more or less correctly (oversized and with a aspect ratio something like 3:4, but I am able to scroll it); and because the video appears correctly in Tusky.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.social\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.4.0-nightly.2024-11-19\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nFirefox 130.0.1\n\n### Operating system\n\nUbuntu 24.04.1 LTS\n\n### Technical details\n\nThe video was taken on a Sony XPeria 5 III running Android 13, and not processed.\n\nIf I download the image locally and feed it into ffmpeg -i, I find something interesting for the video track:\n\n```\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from '522354ab61852ad8.mp4':\n  Metadata:\n    major_brand     : isom\n    minor_version   : 512\n    compatible_brands: isomiso2avc1mp41\n    encoder         : Lavf61.7.100\n  Duration: 00:00:15.92, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 17660 kb/s\n  Stream #0:0[0x1](und): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p(tv, bt709, progressive), 1920x1080, 17497 kb/s, 29.96 fps, 29.97 tbr, 90k tbn (default)\n    Metadata:\n      handler_name    : VideoHandler\n      vendor_id       : [0][0][0][0]\n    Side data:\n      displaymatrix: rotation of -90.00 degrees\n```\n\nNotice that the video internally advertises a size of 1920x1080, with a \"rotation of -90 degrees\". I understand this to be a common approach for videos and images taken with cell phones. It looks to me as if the \"bug\" is that although Mastodon's video converter understands the \"1080p plus -90 rotation\", and the browser understands it as well, whatever is storing the metadata that eventually leads to the CSS aspect-ratio is extracting only the \"base\" resolution and not the appropriate transformation which would have changed it from 1920x1080 to 1080x1920.",

Try to log into a Mastodon instance via OIDC/SSO for the first time.\n3. Get a generic error message instead of a shiny new mastodon account.\n\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe display name derived from OIDC claims should be truncated to the maximum allowed length automatically, but still accepted. Users can fix their display name themselves later.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nAccount creation fails and the user cannot log in.\n\n### Detailed description\n\nWhen an OIDC user logs in for the first time, an account is created automatically. The display name passed to `User.new` via `account_attributes.display_name` is derived from OIDC claims (either `full_name`, `name` or `first_name + ' ' + last_name`). If this display name is longer than `DISPLAY_NAME_LENGTH_LIMIT` (30 characters) then the associated `Account` instance cannot be saved and fails validation. The `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception is handled by returning a generic `devise.failure.omniauth_user_creation_failure` error message to the user. The actual root cause is not logged and it took me a while to find out what went wrong.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\n_No response_\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.3.8\n\n### Technical details\n\n- Ruby version: official docker images\n- Node.js version: official docker images\n",

          "issue_body": "### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\n1. Download a video or gifv attachment in mp4 format from Mastodon\n2. Use `atomicparsley [file] -T` to view the structure of the video file\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`moov` atom should occur immediately after `ftyp` at the beginning of the file (this is what the ffmpeg `faststart` option does)\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\n`moov` atom is the last thing at the end of the file\n\n### Detailed description\n\nDepending on the browser/client implementation, this results in the video not being able to start until the entire file is downloaded.\n\nIn Safari 18.5 at least, *some* videos are still able to start playing before the download finishes, but still with a few seconds delay. From watching the Network tab in the web inspector, I can see that the browser is doing some kind of workaround where it makes a request for the bytes at the beginning of the file, sees that the `moov` atom isn’t there, makes another request for the entire file in order to get the file size, immediately cancels that request, makes a third request for the bytes at the end of the file where the `moov` atom is located, then makes more request(s) for the actual video data. This adds a lot of latency – I would imagine they would start faster if this data was at the beginning of the file to begin with.\n\nIn addition, I’m not sure exactly how Mastodon’s remote media proxy/caching interacts with this, but I don’t think Safari’s workaround is working for videos federated from other servers, which always take 10+ seconds to start for me.\n\nAn example of a video I ran across where this occurs is https://mastodon.durrans.com/@dan/114530514378397295 – it doesn’t seem to be encoded for fast start regardless of whether I view it on the original server (4.3.8) or mastodon.online (v4.4.0-alpha.5+pr-34450-b0f4baf). I also did a search for “has:video” and checked a few of the results; none of them were encoded for fast start.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.online\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.4.0-alpha.5+pr-34450-b0f4baf\n\n### Technical details\n\n_No response_",

Safely accessing `uncached` here results in the ultimate error state of \"we have no cached or uncached data for this emoji\" to be a simple rendering of the emoji shortcode in the text of the post, like so:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1993023b-fb5d-4dfc-a3b3-0b2f82132e86)\r\n\r\nNote: I have no idea what's idiomatic in Ruby these days but it seems like the Mastodon source code in general prefers appending `if uncached` for safety rather than something like `uncached&.[](shortcode)`",
