The problem, at least for me, was that this custom length is deeply buried inside a controller. I would have expected us to have set the configuration value on the model instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the value from the method call in the controller to the configuration value in the controller.\r\n\r\nI think this has another, theoretical benefit: If we ever call `User.generate_otp_secret` from another place, we would have consistent secret lengths.",

I think that's fine ... but if we were getting some value (\"hi, I make a network request!\" or something) out of the bang-method naming, I can move it to lib instead.\r\n\r\nSeparately - I noticed while doing this that the two primary users of this method (`ResolveAccountService` and `FetchRemoteActorService`) have considerable overlap on the webfinger/acct parsing, fetching, error handling, etc. It's not exactly 1:1, but I suspect we could extract a class there which would do a little de-duping, make both those classes smaller, and consolidate the logic into a better-named webfinger-specific place?

Easiest choices are things like \"25 starred/boosted toots\", but what is the right number? 25? 10? 50? So maybe a better approach is \"top starred/boosted toot of the past X minutes\" ... but possibly harder to implement.\r\n\r\nWithout something like this, new/small instances are stuck in a chicken-and-egg situation.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched or browsed the repo’s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate.\r\n",

Try fetching the post (by searching its URL) on another instance (instance B) where the defunct account is not cached\r\n3. You will get the following error: 503 Remote data could not be fetched\r\n\r\nProblem 2 - federation:\r\n1. Have an account (account A) on an instance (instance A) where some defunct account is cached\r\n2. Have an account on another instance (instance B) where the defunct account is not cached\r\n3. Follow account A from account B\r\n4. From account A, write a post that mentions the defunct account\r\n5. This post never reaches instance B, i.e., the post is not visible on account A's profile on instance B\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe post should federate / be fetched as expected\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe post doesn't federate and cannot be fetched manually, resulting in an error\r\n\r\n### Detailed description\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nThe post https://mastodon.pirati.cz/@keddie/112879938095998245 mentions the account `@honza@datastory.cz` (which should lead to https://gts.datastory.cz/users/honza), but it's defunct. The instance **mastodon.pirati.cz** has this account cached, so it can be mentioned without any problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the instance **mamutovo.cz**, this account is not cached. So even though I follow the author of the post (`@keddie@mastodon.pirati.cz`), I am not able to see the post on my instance. Attempting to manually fetch the post results in the described error.\r\n\r\n### Mastodon instance\r\n\r\nmamutovo.cz\r\n\r\n### Mastodon version\r\n\r\nv4.2.10\r\n\r\n### Browser name and version\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome 127.0.6533.100\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Solved with a sequence on the fabricator.\r\n- Expand the export spec to add coverage for both the \"to csv\" and \"count\" methods where they were totally missing\r\n- For both the missing ones and existing ones, on the csv specs, actually use `CSV.parse` to interpret the results -- this strikes me as useful in catching anything we change which makes these totally unparseable for whatever reason\r\n\r\nSome of the new coverage here is pretty barebones and just exercising code paths and asserting *something* but there's room for more precision there in future.\r\n\r\nThe refactor I have in mind is some combination of:\r\n\r\n- Separate the \"what are the various summary count values for an account\" and \"generate csv exports for an account\" aspects of this\r\n- Within the counting one, explore whether we can shove the counting early enough in the controller that we can utilize `async`, similar to other PRs\r\n- For the export portion, explore doing a per-type class which would just have `to_csv` and inherit from base class (like `BookmarkExport` or something ... sort of TBD)\r\n- Add headers for exports where they are missing",

This was about as far as I was willing to go w/out shoring that up more\r\n- Next obvious thing here to do would be pull out even more of the request stuff from the worker, and have it handled by either this new class, or some other new class which can build headers/payloads with this class and wrap the request.",

I think this is a regression, I feel like I've done this series of steps before but not seen the problem.\r\n\r\nBelow is a video (due to some sort of bug on my computer, the mouse cursor appears fixed in this video, although it is in fact moving).\r\n\r\nSteps in video:\r\n- Start from a new mastodon.social window.\r\n- Do a search (in this search from:mcc, so I get my own posts)\r\n- Select a post with an image. It will appear in the rightmost column.\r\n- Click ⋯ on the post in the rightmost column and choose \"Edit\".\r\n- The image from the edited post ONLY appears floating atop the search column. \r\n\r\n[Screencast from 2024-10-01 17-36-31.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f5eb1b4-ad24-46b7-b002-54939cbce228)\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nChoosing \"edit\" should dismiss the search column.

If you now post your video post, the Alt text is missing.\r\n...\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe Alt text should of course be kept alive and kicking ;-)\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe Alt text is dropped.\n\n### Detailed description\n\nWhen using a custom thumbnail for videos, the Alt text vanishes when the toot is posted.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when adding a custom thumbnail.\r\nI can work around it if after posting I re-edit the post, enter the Alt text again and re-post.\r\nI have tested this on mastodon.art, zirk.us and Vivaldi.social.\r\nThe bug is around for as long as I can remember, several years I think.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.art, zirk.us and Vivaldi.social\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.2.12 and earlier\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nVivaldi for the last year or more, Firefox\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10 and 11\n\n### Technical details\n\n_No response_",
