          "issue_body": "### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\n1. Load `/api/v1/accounts/[id]/featured_hashtags` with the ID of a remote user\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`last_status_at` should show the date of the most recent post from this user using that hashtag that is either public or viewable to the person making the query\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\n`last_status_at` shows a long ago date for a hashtag with recent public posts. I think `statuses_count` is also incorrect. I also found at least one example (possibly specific to the web UI) where a future date is displayed as the last usage date of a featured hashtag, even though the user’s posts are all dated correctly.\n\n### Detailed description\n\nI’ve seen this frequently on multiple servers where it will either give a long ago date or even say “no posts” for a featured hashtag that someone uses very frequently. I can see the user’s posts just fine from the affected server so it’s not an issue of the posts not federating. When looking at my own featured hashtags on my own server, or looking at local users’ featured hashtags, the date appears to be correct, only remote accounts seem to be affected.\n\nFor example, https://mastodon.social/api/v1/accounts/109281825849025262/featured_tags should be the featured tags of my own mastodon.online account, viewed from mastodon.social. The `last_status_at` for the swiftui hashtag is `2024-02-19`, almost a year ago, but I’ve posted about it several times since then, including in the last few days.\n\nPossibly related to #22665 where someone saw the `last_status_at` date getting updated correctly but not the `statuses_count`. In my case, the `last_status_at` is also incorrect.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.social, mastodon.online, mastodon.gamedev.place\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.4.0-nightly.2024-12-18, v4.3.2\n\n### Technical details\n\n_No response_",

Attach four images;\n3. Try to remove one of the images.\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI should be able to click the \"X\" button to remove an image.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nBoth the \"X\" and the \"Edit\" buttons don't respond to clicks, only \"ALT\" does.\n\n### Detailed description\n\nThis screenshot illustrates the problem:\n\n<img width=\"363\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ade3868-4f81-4f7f-bb29-231130480915\" />\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.social\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.4.0-alpha.1+pr-33401-1ac8df0\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nChrome 131.0.6778.265\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS 15.2\n\n### Technical details\n\nThe unresponsive buttons are laid out under the `<div class=\"compose-form__upload__warning\">` element. If I set `pointer-events: none` on that, the \"X\" and \"Edit\" buttons work. However, the \"ALT\" button (which is part of the aforementioned element) stops working.\n\nIn the past the images didn't get squashed so much vertically in the editor. Currently the `<div class=\"compose-form__uploads media-gallery media-gallery--layout-3\">` has `min-height: 64px` and it should perhaps be `150px` instead, for the overlaid controls to remain properly separated.",

This is no longer the case.\n\nWhile I can understand \"Filtered\" being a reasonable default for the \"Unsolicited private mentions\" notification setting, there needs to be an exception for admin and mod accounts.\n\nAs an admin, I need to be able to communicate privately with my users for a variety of reasons, and reasonably expect that they will be notified when I send them a message, for reasons including:\n- sending introductory messages welcoming them to the server and informing them of server rules, norms, tips on getting started, etc...\n- providing private technical support if the user appears to be facing an issue\n- discussing moderation actions, such as rule violations, following up on reports from the user, etc..\n\nMy ability to do these things as an admin is currently stunted, as I cannot rely on my users being notified when I send them messages. \n\nDepending on the importance of the message I can simply accept they may never see that message, or I need to escalate my contact efforts, such as sending a public message to check their private messages, using the moderation warning system, or sending an email to their registered account.

I didn't look at each error, though.\n\nThe journalctl rows from the first time the error appeared is attached. I think I got all, or more of the relevant rows.\n\n[CardinalityViolation.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18769336/CardinalityViolation.txt)\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\noldfriends.live\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.3.3\n\n### Technical details\n\nIf this is happening on your own Mastodon server, please fill out those:\n- Ruby version: v3.3.5\n- Node.js version: v20.17.0\n\nI posted a question on Mastodon about this to see if anyone else was getting this error and Renchap replied to file a report. https://oisaur.com/@renchap/113990485085328900\n",
