The presentation of a Content Warning post and a Show Anyway filtered post is very similar, so it makes sense to use the same keyboard binding to \"open up\" either of these.\n\nThe functionality of `o` is different, as it opens up the post in a different column in the \"advanced\" view.  This is particularly significant if you're viewing the post in the middle of a number of custom columns (the \"opening\" is always in the right most column, causing a lateral shift in the view).",

Enable \"Reduce motion in animations\" at Preference > Appearance\n3. Visit a post or profile of someone whose name has animated custom emojis\n    + Example: Accessing <https://mystical.garden/@fionafokus/114224269339074787> from the search box (as of 2025-03-26) (contains `:loading:` custom emoji in the user name)\n4. You'll see the animated loading animation regardless of the preference.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nweb UI shows still image instead of playing animated custom emojis\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nanimated emojis in the user name are always played\n\n### Detailed description\n\nAccount icons are not auto-played (if some options set?) even when they are animated images. User can play them by mouse hover if they want. This is the expected behaviour of disabled \"auto-play animated GIFs\" (and/or enabled \"Reduce motions in animation\") for images in general, not only for account icons but also for custom emojis in user names.\n\nHowever, this option does not work to the custom emojis in the user name, so currently users cannot disable animations in that position. This is very distracting.\n\n### Mastodon instance\n\nmastodon.cardina1.red\n\n### Mastodon version\n\nv4.3.6\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nFirefox 136.0.2\n\n### Operating system\n\nGentoo Linux (amd64, Linux 6.13.8)\n\n### Technical details\n\n_No response_",
